### Project Overview

The goal of the Zomato Analysis project was to gain insights into the restaurant landscape across different countries,cities, and cuisines.   By analyzing zomato's restaurant data , I aimed to identify trends, understand customer preferences, and highlight key factors that contribute to a restaurant's success.

### Tools

- MS Excel - Data Cleaning
- MySql   - data analysis
- PowerBi - creating reports



### Approach

- Imported the dataset of 9,500 restaurants across 10 countries into Power BI for analysis
- Cleaned and transformed data to make it analysis-ready
- Developed questions and metrics to analyze: restaurant counts, growth over time, price ranges, ratings, amenities
- Built interactive Power BI dashboards with visualizations to uncover and showcase insights

### Observations

- India is the largest market with 8,652 restaurants, while New Zealand had just 40
- Restaurant growth was steady from 2010-2018 at ~1,000 new openings per year
- 47% restaurants are inexpensive with price less than $10
- Independent restaurants rated higher than chains
- 74% offer delivery but only 12% allow table bookings

### Outcomes

- Identified India, Singapore, and South Africa as countries with the most restaurants per capita, indicating strong food culture
- Recognized steady growth of casual/quick service restaurants, aligning with global dining trends
- Noticed cuisine gaps in different cities, suggesting opportunities to attract certain cuisines
- Pinpointed differences in ratings and amenities by cuisine type and restaurant class
  
This project enabled data-driven decision making by unlocking insights around Zomato's restaurant ecosystem. The observations and trends identified could help Zomato improve platform features, target marketing efforts, identify expansion opportunities, and better meet the needs of restaurants and diners.
